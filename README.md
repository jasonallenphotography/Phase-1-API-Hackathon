# Phase 1 API Hackathon

----------------------

This is a simple MVC-patterned terminal app that was created during a 3 hour scratch-to-demo hackathon by the following developers:


Jason Allen - [jasonallenphotography on GitHub](https://github.com/jasonallenphotography)

Theo Paul - [theomarkkuspaul on GitHub](https://github.com/theomarkkuspaul)

Ayaz Uddin - [Ayaz2589 on GitHub](https://github.com/Ayaz2589)

Joseph Yoo - [notjoeyoo on GitHub](https://github.com/notjoeyoo)


Our app draws its data from NYC OpenData's [database of major felony offenses](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-7-Major-Felony-Incidents/hyij-8hr7), specifically from the past whole calendar year (2015) and the current year (2016) to date.

### Overview
Goal: to build an app that tells users how safe their police precinct is in the morning, afternoon, nighttime, or based on a user-defined range of time. Our app will return the total count of the 7 major felonies committed during the selected window of time. If a precinct is over a threshold that we deemed particularly unsafe, the app will recommend that the user get out of that area!
